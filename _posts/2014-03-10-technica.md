Technica is an all-ladies hackathon at the University of Maryland promoting women in tech.

Hackathons are a great way to meet people who love making things and get involved in the tech community. However, not many women attend. Given that hackathons are where people come together to get introduced to tech and learn new skills, it’s a great opportunity to bring women into tech - especially beginners just starting out.

At the University of Maryland, we had the idea to create a ladies-only hackathon. This way, women would feel comfortable attending, asking questions, and meeting others like them. Our ultimate goal was for women new to tech to feel less intimidated attending co-ed hackathons, and long-term involvement in the tech community.

As part of the organizing design team, I was responsible for designing the apparel, schedule, and the physical space of the hackathon. I got involved with the marketing prior to the event as well. During the event I handled logistics and operations - walkie-talkie and everything!

<b>Apparel</b>

The mission of the hackathon apparel was to print a badass shirt that ladies will proudly wear long after the hackathon ended. Arranging the logos was like a puzzle. There were many different shapes, sizes, and colors, and the logos had to be consistent. Each logo carried its own visual weight. I spent a lot of time fine tuning the size of the logos. It wasn’t just a matter of centering them, but sizing them according to their visual weight as well.

Some logos needed to be placed higher than others (sponsorship tiers), while some logos needed to be placed closer to others. This took a while because as I was making the shirt, more sponsors were added and the order kept changing.

Initially, the header stated, “The all-ladies hackathon” in lowercase letters. I changed it to title case (“The All-Ladies Hackathon”) because it was more badass and confident. For a hackathon promoting women in tech, this seemed appropriate. 

<b>Interior Space Decor</b>

Purposeful decor creates a sense of specialness, community, and liveliness. Most hackathons are just a lot of tables and outlets - we wanted the space to amplify the feeling of community. We put up banners, streamers, lights, and lots of other Technica colored decor.

One of my favorite parts about organizing Technica was our team. We weren’t just a group students organizing an event together, we became close friends. Each member had their own unique quirky personality, which made it really fun/ny to work together. Even today when I think back at our months prepping, I smile big. And our energy totally reflected during the actual event - it spread not just between team members, but to participants, mentors, sponsors, and volunteers as well. Technica’s success is owed to the powerful team behind it.

In the end, 400 ladies and 100 mentors attended Technica. Of the participants, 75% were first-time hackers, 20% were high school students, and 30% came from out of state.
