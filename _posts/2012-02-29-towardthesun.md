Towards the Sun is an online store through which I sold my handmade polymer clay bowls.

Selling the bowls startet out as a fun side project. I'd never meant for it to become an entreprenenurial endeave, but at some point there were 20+ bowls lying around my dorm room and I needed something to do with them.

I used Etsy as a platform to sell. Etsy taught me about the world of ecommerce and shipment of physical products: how it wasnâ€™t just about making the product, but about the hollistic picture and works of ecommerce: customer service, branding, and shipping.
