An API for University of Maryland data.

I designed the documentation for this open-source project. I looked at other popular APIs for inspiration &mdash; mainly the [StripeAPI](), [Android Developer Docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/index.html) and [Travis CI API](http://docs.travis-ci.com/api/).

I also designed the structure of the API itself, with the end-user (other developers) in mind. I used a RESTful-like structure as my base.
