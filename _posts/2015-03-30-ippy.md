Ippy is a copy-to-clipboard emoticon website. 

I use emoticons (read: "ippies") on messenger all the time and usually Google search the face I want each time over again from scratch. That became a bit tedious (and stopped me from sending faces), so Nick Aversano and I created this site to make that process a lil bit easier (and more fun ＼(＾▽＾)／).

This was the first time I'd fully coded my designs from scratch. I'd come into this project with the intent of learning to code (we used HTML, CSS, JS, and Ruby) - I wanted to know what it was like to code something so that I could communicate better with developers and execute more ideas and designs by myself/faster.

When Nick and I launched the site, it got a lot of excited feedback from our community, and found that people were using them on a daily basis (and even saved this site in their bookmarks!).

We wanted to make ippy even more exciting by adding a postcard feature that would allow a user to create a postcard. Though in the end we only stuck with only one (copy-to-clipboard) function, I had a ton of fun designing and brainstorming the order a postcard process, which are shown below!
