Created this Promo video before the launch of the new makerspace, Sandbox, on the University of Maryland campus!

Josh Sheldon and I worked together to come up with the idea "coming together of makers" and specifically used different types of tools and objects (all from the actual space!) in this shot to show that this makerspace is for students from all different majors and backgrounds coming together in one space to build awesome things!

We used clay and chose stop-motion as our medium to enhance the do-it-yourself, maker-ie look.
